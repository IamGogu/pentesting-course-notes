cd - used to move to specified location

```
root@Desktop:~# cd Desktop/
root@Desktop:~/Desktop#
```


After you start to write the directory name you want to navigate to, you can
hit TAB and it will auto-complete the path for you. If nothing shows up, it
means that there are more than one locations that start with the same letters.
In this case, hit TAB twice and it will show you the options you have. writing
more than one letter will be better


```
root@Desktop:~# cd D
Desktop/   Documents/ Downloads/
root@Desktop:~# cd Desktop/
root@Desktop:~/Desktop#
```


You could go back a directory using "cd .."


```
root@Desktop:~/Desktop# cd ..
root@Desktop:~#
```

Also if you want to change directory from a totally different path and you
want it to auto-complete, you have to use a forward slash "/" before typing
the first letter and then "TAB"
