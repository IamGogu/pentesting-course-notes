cp - used to copy files from and to a specified folder
   - can also copy directories if using "-r"

In the example underneath, I will create a file called "file.txt" and a
directory called "Folder". I will be then copying the file inside the newly
created directory and then copy that directory inside Documents/

Creating the file and directory:
```
root@Desktop:~# echo "hello" > file.txt
root@Desktop:~# mkdir Folder
root@Desktop:~# ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  file.txt  Folder  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
root@Desktop:~#
```

Copying the file to Folder/
```
root@Desktop:~# cp file.txt Folder/
root@Desktop:~# ls Folder/
file.txt
root@Desktop:~#
```

Copying the directory Folder/ with everything inside to Documents/
```
root@Desktop:~# cp -r Folder/ Documents/
root@Desktop:~# ls Documents/
 Folder  'Zero to Hero Pentesting'
root@Desktop:~# ls Documents/Folder/
file.txt
root@Desktop:~#
```
