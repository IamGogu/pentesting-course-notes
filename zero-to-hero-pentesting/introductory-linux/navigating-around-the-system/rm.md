rm - used to remove a file or a directory. In order to remove the contents of
a directory as well as the directory, you have to use "-r" before specifying
the directory to be deleted

It is better to remove directories with ["rmdir"](rmdir.md) command

Removing one file
```
root@Desktop:~# cd Documents/Folder/
root@Desktop:~/Documents/Folder# ls
'file 1.txt'   file.txt
root@Desktop:~/Documents/Folder# rm 'file 1.txt'
root@Desktop:~/Documents/Folder# ls
file.txt
root@Desktop:~/Documents/Folder#
```

Removing the directory with all files included
```
root@Desktop:~/Documents# ls
 Folder  'Zero to Hero Pentesting'
root@Desktop:~/Documents# rm -r Folder/
root@Desktop:~/Documents# ls
'Zero to Hero Pentesting'
root@Desktop:~/Documents#
```
